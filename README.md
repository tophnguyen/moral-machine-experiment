# moral-machine-experiment

The data used for this project comes from the Moral Machine Experiment, a platform for gathering
human perspectives on moral decisions made by intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles.
Participants can visit the moral machine website to take the experiment, which provides 13 different
ethical dilemma scenarios where an AV has to make a decision (e.g hitting a barrier, killing everyone in
the car or hitting an elderly person).

Goal: Predict saved outcomes by an AV based on various moral dilemmas

# Data source 
The data can be accessed and downloaded from the OSF homepage as a .csv file. The data weâ€™ll be
using is the SharedResponseSurvey.csv, which contains responses from all participants who took the
experiment and filled out the survey at the end.
